        <h1>Analyzing Video Game Market Trends</h1>
        <h3> Caleb (visualization 1 and 2), Joshua (visualization 3 and 4), Dimitry (Visualization 5) </h3>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            The topic that we chose for our project is the analysis of video games sales and ratings over roughly the
            past two decades. Specifically, we would like to analyze variables such as production year, video game
            critic score, video game user score, maturity ratings, platform type, and sales across various regions. We
            find this topic relevant because over the past years, video games have become really popular, and not just
            amongst teenagers, but also across younger and older age groups. Furthermore, because gaming became popular
            in the early 2000s, the current data doesn’t only include trends of those who play games currently, but also
            includes those who played video games back when they were younger, and still play them now, which can be an
            interesting point of insight to compare current video game consumer culture vs older video game consumer
            culture. Most importantly, we believe it would be of interest to analyze console usage across the world with
            video game genre, video game genre with sales, video game genre with maturity rating, sales with critic vs.
            user score, etc. Many insights and trends can be derived from the comparison of the dataset parameters, and
            comparing the strength of certain relations over others, for example, whether user rating or critic rating
            lead to a greater increase in sales, we believe would prove interesting.

        The following are two studies related to our topic:
        <p>
            T. Kraemer, W. H. Weiger, and S. Heidenreich, “Do all stars shine the same? Investigating the nonlinear
            effects of user and critic reviews on video game sales,” Journal of Business Research, vol. 188, p. 115034,
            Nov. 2024, doi: <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2024.115034">
                https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2024.115034</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this Science Direct article, the authors examine how video game sales are influenced by both professional
            and user reviews. They analyzed the sales and review data of 1,642 video games using models that account for
            nonlinear effects of review valence on sales. The results show a positive relationship between sales and
            reviews, but with nonlinear patterns. For user reviews, the positive effect weakens at higher levels,
            meaning there is little difference in sales impact between good and very good user ratings. In contrast, the
            positive effect of critic reviews grows stronger at higher levels, highlighting that critic reviews are more
            influential and continue to play a strong signaling role in this industry. These findings are valuable for
            video game producers and marketers. For example, boosting critic scores through additional avenues like
            early access or press previews may yield additional gains for already well-reviewed games. Emphasizing
            engagement with critics and securing high-profile reviews remains essential, while for lesser-known or
            mid-tier titles, improving average user reviews can lead to meaningful increases in sales.

            In this Boya Century Publishing article, the author provides an overview of the general trends in the gaming
            industry over the past few years. The provide interesting insights in how conditions in regions can lead to
            more video game sales, such as in 2007, when Namibia had lower internet access than the rest of the world,
            which lead to the most video game sales being there during that year; whereas, in other regions, people
            preferred to use their phones for video games, which led to less sales. Furthermore, the author points out
            general trends in preferred genres, where action games are the most popular nowadays.

        Based on the images, there is a correlation between critic score and user score, although not strong.


        <h2> About Our Dataset </h2>
        <p>
            The data which we decided to use for the project is from the following Kaggle dataset: <a
                href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/video-game-sales-and-ratings"> link </a>. The
            dataset includes roughly 15,000 entries (roughly becomes some games repeat, and some row entries are
            not full). The data is scraped off of an online game rating, review, and tracker website: VGChartz.
            The dataset includes 17 columns comprising both categorial variables (such as publisher name, ESRB
            rating, etc.) and continuous variables (such as sales, critic rating, year of release, etc.).
            However, the dataset has some flaws as well, mainly that it only goes up until the 2018th year.
            Therefore, our group may merge similar datasets for more recent years, or scrape VGChartz ourselves;
            to keep the dataset reasonably sized, we can cut off earlier years before the 21st century.
            Furthermore, it would also be interesting to analyze video game perception before its release. While
            it would be hard to analyze marketing strategies, advertisements, conference gatherings, and
            trailers, it might be possible to gather activity metrics from popular video game blog websites such
            as Reddit.
        </p>
        <p>
            In terms of preprocessing, the data already has a really good user rating. All we had to do was just to
            coerce values to either floats for numerical or strings for categorical data, and mark them as NaN if not
            possible. Lastly, we removed each row in which there was at least one NaN value.
        </p>

        <h2> Dataset </h2>

        <h2> Our Analysis </h2>

        <iframe src="scatterplot.html"></iframe>
        <p>
            This visualization displays the relationship between Critic Score and User Score for each video game in the
            dataset using a scatterplot. Each point mark represents a single game. The position channels (x = critic
            score, y = user score) encode two quantitative attributes (on a 0-100 scale) to help users identify
            correlations, clusters, and outliers across the industry. The color channel encodes the game’s ESRB
            (Entertainment Software Rating Board) content rating (a categorical attribute), while the size channel
            represents global sales in millions to emphasize games with larger sale impact.
        </p>
        <p>
            To support exploration, the visualization provides multiple interactive filters, including genre, rating,
            developer, platform, and minimum global sales. This allows users to search for specific subsets of the data
            or to compare groups. This makes the tool useful for high-level analysis tasks such as discovering which
            types of games tend to receive high ratings from both critics and players, identifying market trends, or
            examining how content rating relates to commercial performance.

            Notably, games rated E (Everyone) show the highest sales overall, likely due to their broader accessibility.
        </p>

        <iframe src="barchart.html"></iframe>
        <p>
            This visualization summarizes the total video game sales across five regions: Japan, Europe, North America,
            Other regions, and Global totals. Each bar mark represents a region, using length/height to show total sales
            volume. Color is used as a categorical channel to distinguish the regions from one another.
        </p>
        <p>
            To support exploration, the visualization includes interactive filters for genre, ESRB (Entertainment
            Software Rating Board) rating, developer, and platform, allowing users to refine the view and compare how
            regional sales distributions change across different subsets of games. This makes the chart useful for
            identifying market patterns and understanding how particular categories of games perform in different
            geographic areas.

            Overall and among individual regions, North America generates the highest revenue, followed by Europe, while
            Japan consistently shows the lowest total sales within this dataset.
        </p>

        <iframe src="linechart.html"></iframe>
        <p>
            This visualization in a line chart for the year and the total global sales in millions of dollars for that
            year. Each line on the line chard represents a genre of a video game.
        </p>
        <p>
            From the line chart we can see that over the years, all genres have fallen in popularity while shooter,
            sports, and action games have risen on-net. The only exception is the sudden plunder in 2016, but this can
            be explained by the fact that the data was scraped from a blog, so perhaps the blog website became less
            popular and outdated.
        </p>

        <iframe src="bubblechart.html"></iframe>
        <p>
            The above visualization is a bubble chart between video game genre and platform, where the bubble size
            corresponds to global sales in millions of dollars.
        </p>
        <p>
            What we can see from the visualization is that different platforms have seen different levels of success
            across genres, suggesting that perhaps those specific platofrms are godo for the specific genre of game
            (e.g. Wii for sports games), or the games the platform made were good for the genre. Perhaps a combination
            of both.
        </p>

        <iframe src="producer_genres_mosaic.html"></iframe>
        <p>
            The above visualization is a mosaic plot between major video game companies and genres. Hovering over a
            mosaic states its percent share for the company of their genres, as well as the most used platform for that
            genre for the company that made the game.
        </p>
        <p>
            From this visualization we can gather that certain companies prefer certain genres. For example, EA prefers
            sports games, while Nintendo prefers platform and role-playing games. This could mean that certain audiences
            where certain platforms have market share are exposed more to one type of game to another, which could
            impact video game culture in a region.
        </p>


        <h2> Conclusion </h2>
        We noticed a few key findings:
        <ol>
            <li> Despite popular online drama about video-game critics poorly representing popular games, the dataset
                showed otherwise. There was a positive correlation between user rating and critic rating for video
                games, and this rating had an especially strong correlation for those games that had large sales.</li>
            <li> While Japan is a big producer of Video-Games, their market produces far less income than across Europe,
                North America, and other countries. The only game genres in which Japanese consumer sales exceed those
                of the others is for fighting games, platformers, and especially role-playing games.</li>
            <li> Many video-game companies produce only specific games, and many platforms promote specific companies.
                For example, XBox promotes EA games, which are mainly sports games Therefore, gaming culture looks
                different in Northern America where XBox may have a larger share of the market in contrast to Japan,
                where Nintendo and associated role-playing games have a larger share.</li>
        </ol>
        If our analysis were to be improved, here is what we think are the main points:
        <ol>
            <li> It would have been good to also consider marketing and general feedback from consumers, beacuse that
                would also have a lot to say about video game culture in certain regions and how video games are sold
                there. For this level of analysis, the dataset would have to have been expanded by scraping perhaps
                online gaming forums like Reddit and Steam.</li>
            <li> More in-depth research on the topic would help destinguish between causation and correlation
                relationships. For example, although there is a positive correlation between user rating and critic
                score, it is unclear whether perhaps critic score follows user rating, if user rating is influenced by
                critic score, or if there is another factor.</li>
        </ol>
